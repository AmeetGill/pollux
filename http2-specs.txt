A client that makes a request for an "http" URI without prior
   knowledge about support for HTTP/2 on the next hop uses the HTTP
   Upgrade mechanism (Section 6.7 of [RFC7230]).  The client does so by
   making an HTTP/1.1 request that includes an Upgrade header field with
   the "h2c" token.  Such an HTTP/1.1 request MUST include exactly one
   HTTP2-Settings (Section 3.2.1) header field.A server MUST NOT upgrade the connection to HTTP/2 if this header
  field is not present or if more than one is present.  A server MUST
  NOT send this header field.

   For example:

     GET / HTTP/1.1
     Host: server.example.com
     Connection: Upgrade, HTTP2-Settings
     Upgrade: h2c
     HTTP2-Settings: <base64url encoding of HTTP/2 SETTINGS payload>

Requests that contain a payload body MUST be sent in their entirety
before the client can send HTTP/2 frames.  This means that a large
request can block the use of the connection until it is completely sent.

If concurrency of an initial request with subsequent requests is
   important, an OPTIONS request can be used to perform the upgrade to
   HTTP/2, at the cost of an additional round trip.


A server MUST ignore an "h2" token in an Upgrade header field.
   Presence of a token with "h2" implies HTTP/2 over TLS, which is
   instead negotiated as described

A request that upgrades from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2 MUST include exactly
   one "HTTP2-Settings" header field.  The HTTP2-Settings header field
   is a connection-specific header field that includes parameters that
   govern the HTTP/2 connection, provided in anticipation of the server
   accepting the request to upgrade.
